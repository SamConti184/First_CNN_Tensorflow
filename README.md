# First_CNN_Tensorflow
My first attempt in understanding and coding a Convolutional Neural Network using the Tensorflow Framework.
Based on the official tutorial (https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/estimators/cnn), I also performed some mild image augmentation.
More importantly, I used the Dataset API provided by Tensorflow to build a more efficient input data pipeline.
It was an interesting experiment to better understand the general functioning of Tensorflow (the Dataset and Estimator APIs in particular) and the general concepts of Image Classification via Convolutional Neural Netowrks.
The Dataset that was used was provided by Kaggle, involving a binary classification task on cells affected or not by malaria (https://www.kaggle.com/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria).
